Simple Product Landing Page
This repository contains a basic product landing page and a success page for a simulated purchase, designed to demonstrate a simple e-commerce flow.

Project Structure
The project consists of two main HTML files:

landing-page.html: This is the main page displaying two sample products with "Buy Now" buttons.

thank-you-page.html: This page serves as a confirmation page displayed after a successful simulated purchase.

Features
Product Display: Showcases two distinct products with images, descriptions, prices, and call-to-action buttons.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a good user experience across various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Clear Call to Action: "Buy Now" buttons are prominent and designed for user engagement.

Purchase Confirmation: A dedicated "Thank You" page to confirm a successful transaction.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure of the web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.

Placeholder.co: Used for placeholder images in the product cards.

How to View
To view these pages:

Save the files: Copy the content of the landing-page.html and thank-you-page.html into two separate .html files (e.g., index.html and thank_you.html).

Open in Browser: Simply open index.html (or whatever you named your landing page) in your web browser.

Simulated Purchase: The "Buy Now" buttons on the landing page currently link to #. To simulate a purchase and see the thank you page, you would typically integrate a payment gateway that redirects to thank_you.html upon success. For this simple setup, you can manually navigate to thank_you.html to see the confirmation.

Future Improvements (Ideas)
Actual Product Pages: Create dedicated pages for each product with more detailed information.

Shopping Cart Functionality: Implement a basic shopping cart using JavaScript.

Form Submission: Add a simple form on the product pages or a checkout page to gather customer information.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate with a real (or mock) payment gateway.

More Products: Expand the product catalog.

Navigation Bar: Add a navigation bar for better site navigation.

Backend Integration: Connect with a backend to manage products, orders, and user data.
